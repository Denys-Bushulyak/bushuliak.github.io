I am Software Engineer and software solution
architect with deep experience in building distributed
systems and modern web applications. Over the past
few years, i was concentrated on developing backend
services in Rust while also contributing to frontend
layers using React and modern JavaScript frameworks.
I have experience with a wide range of
systems — from ERP platforms to real-time logistics
tools — and has worked across multiple stacks,
including Node.js, PHP, and .NET. I take pride in
writing robust, testable code, implementing
architectural patterns like Hexagonal and CQRS, and
designing infrastructure that’s ready for growth.
